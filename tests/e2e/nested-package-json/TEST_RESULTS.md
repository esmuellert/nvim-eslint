# Test Results: Diagnostics with .git Repository

## Summary

✅ **DIAGNOSTICS ARE WORKING** with `.git` directory properly initialized!

## Test Configuration

- **Test Project**: `tests/e2e/nested-package-json/`
- **Test File**: `sub-dir/some-other-dir/file-to-lint.ts`
- **Intermediate package.json**: `sub-dir/package.json` (present)
- **.git Location**: Test project root (initialized via `setup-git.sh`)

## Test Results

### Root Directory Resolution

**With .git properly initialized:**
```
Root dir: /home/runner/work/nvim-eslint/nvim-eslint/tests/e2e/nested-package-json
```
✅ **CORRECT** - Points to the test project root, not the parent repository

### Diagnostics

**Count**: 7 diagnostics found

**Details**:
1. `[ERROR]` 'unusedDeepVar' is assigned a value but never used.
2. `[ERROR]` 'unusedDeepVar' is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead.
3. `[ERROR]` 'y' is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead.
4. `[WARNING]` Unexpected console statement.
5. `[ERROR]` 'data' is assigned a value but never used.
6. `[WARNING]` Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
7. `[ERROR]` Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.

### Comparison with ESLint CLI

```bash
$ npx eslint sub-dir/some-other-dir/file-to-lint.ts
✖ 7 problems (5 errors, 2 warnings)
```

✅ **PERFECT MATCH** - nvim-eslint shows the exact same diagnostics as ESLint CLI

## Conclusion

### Root Cause Confirmed

The issue reported in #10 **is resolved when the project has its own `.git` directory**. The problem occurs when:

1. A project is tested/opened without its own `.git` directory
2. The plugin's `root_dir` resolution finds a parent directory's `.git` instead
3. This causes incorrect `workspaceFolder` configuration
4. ESLint server searches from the wrong location
5. Result: No diagnostics, even though ESLint CLI works fine

### Why It Works Now

With `.git` properly initialized in the test project:

1. `vim.fs.root(bufnr, {'.git'})` finds the test project's `.git`
2. `root_dir` correctly resolves to the test project root
3. `workspaceFolder` points to the correct directory
4. ESLint server finds `eslint.config.mjs` in the workspace
5. Intermediate `package.json` in `sub-dir/` does **NOT** interfere
6. Result: ✅ All diagnostics appear correctly

## Key Insight

**The intermediate `package.json` is NOT the problem** when `root_dir` is correct!

The user's original report suggested the intermediate `package.json` caused the issue. However, our testing proves that:

- With **correct `root_dir`** (test project's `.git` found): ✅ Diagnostics work perfectly, intermediate `package.json` is ignored
- With **wrong `root_dir`** (parent repo's `.git` found): ❌ No diagnostics, configuration fails

The intermediate `package.json` only became problematic because it was encountered during ESLint's fallback search when starting from the wrong workspace directory.

## Implications for Users

### User's Environment

The original user's project structure:
```
project/
  .git/              ← Their project HAS .git
  eslint.config.mjs
  package.json
  sub-dir/
    package.json     ← Intermediate package.json
    some-other-dir/
      file-to-lint.ts
```

If their `root_dir` is resolving correctly to `project/`, then:
- Diagnostics should work (as proven by our test)
- The issue might be something else

### Possible Scenarios

1. **User opens Neovim from a parent directory** - `root_dir` might find a parent `.git`
2. **User's `root_dir` resolution is customized** - Different behavior than default
3. **workingDirectory setting override** - User tried custom `workingDirectory` which interfered
4. **ESLint server version differences** - Different resolution behavior in different versions

## Recommendations

1. **For Users**: Verify `root_dir` points to the correct project directory using `:LspInfo`
2. **For Plugin**: Consider changing `root_dir` priority order:
   - Check ESLint config files first (`.eslintrc.*`, `eslint.config.*`)
   - Then check `.git`
   - This prevents parent `.git` from causing issues
3. **Documentation**: Add troubleshooting guide about `root_dir` resolution

## Testing Commands

To reproduce these results:

```bash
cd tests/e2e/nested-package-json

# Setup (required)
./setup-git.sh
npm install

# Run test
nvim -u test-simple.lua --headless

# Manual test
nvim sub-dir/some-other-dir/file-to-lint.ts
# Check :LspInfo for root_dir
# Diagnostics should appear within a few seconds
```
